The [[https://org-trello.github.io][documentation]] has been updated alongside features and fixes. But the [[https://org-trello.github.io/demo.html][video
tutorials]] remained the same.

It has been [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/136][in my mind for a while (~ 5 years or so)]]. Lots of cogs changed over
that period (emacs, org, org-trello, ...). So might as well update some of
them.

For the videos, I would like to use something simple. The result output ideally
rendered in an html page. The html rendered [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello][README.md]] and the [[https://org-trello.github.io][online doc]] are
html pages after all.

So back to basics, an animated video picture would do. I came across
[[https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-gif-screencast][gif-screencast]] which seems nice enough for my endeavor.

I also need a tool which displays what i'm currently typing. I recall [[https://gitlab.com/screenkey/screenkey][screenkey]]
was nice enough.

In the coming days, I should be able to start doing so.
