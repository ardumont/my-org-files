* Rationale

After reading existing tutorials about org-mode and jekyll:
- http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html
- http://www.gorgnegre.com/linux/using-emacs-orgmode-to-blog-with-jekyll.html
- https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/org-mode-publish.html

And making them work...

I was not satisfied with the existing solution.

Why? Because we need to adapt the org-mode file with specific jekyll yaml
settings inside an org-mode html block code.

But here is my thing, I don't want to adapt org with alien yaml or any other
strange metadata. I'd like to have some standard org metadata, for example:

#+begin_src org
#+LAYOUT: post
#+AUTHOR: ardumont
#+DATE: 2014-12-19 Fri 23:49
#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: hidestars
#+OPTIONS: H:2 num:nil tags:nil toc:1 timestamps:t
#+TITLE: hello
#+DESCRIPTION: some description
#+CATEGORIES: some-category
#+end_src

Then publish the blog post (/M-x org2jekyll/publish!/).

Using some emacs-lisp incantation, we can make /org-publish/ and /jekyll/ work
together.

So, here comes https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll...

* Setup

For this to work, you need to have this ready:
- jekyll
- org-publish (/ox-publish/ since 24.4)
- org2jekyll

* Example

Here is my working setup:
- blog: http://ardumont.github.io/blog/
- source: https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll
- setup: https://github.com/ardumont/blog-pack/blob/master/blog-pack.el

* Install

Ok, I'm sold!
How do I install org2jekyll?

Install from [[https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/org2jekyll][marmalade]] available or from [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/releases][github releases]].

** Melpa-stable

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
#+end_src

/M-x package-install RET org2jekyll RET/

Note: You could also use the melpa version which follows more closely the
repository's master branch. I do cut release as soon as possible so there
should not be much advantage over melpa-stable.

** Marmalade

I used to do the work of releasing there as well but I stopped around May 2020
as melpa is way less work to maintain.

** github

I do use the github release mechanism so you can install from there:
#+begin_src sh
wget https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/releases/download/0.2.4/org2jekyll-0.2.4.tar
#+end_src

/M-x package-install-file RET org2jekyll-0.2.4.tar/

Or simply clone the [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll][repository]] and load the org2jekyll.el file.

* Contribution/Issues

I intend to continue maintaining org2jekyll.

As usual, feel free to [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/issues][open issues on the tracker]] or [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/pulls][pull requests]].

I will do my best to answer to issues but that could take some time.

* Inspiration

I used a lot [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog.git][the great org2blog (org -> wordpress bridge)]] and was inspired by
the name and the org headers approach.
