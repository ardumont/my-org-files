Ok, so let's plan a bit the tutorials scenario.

* Basic setup

Here is a basic setup, using helm and modifying the default prefix keybinding.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none
(custom-set-variables
  '(org-trello-input-completion-mechanism 'helm)
  '(org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding "C-c o"))
#+END_SRC

- New buffer
- M-x org-trello-mode
- `C-c x h` to display help message

* Install credentials information (access key and token)

- Open new buffer
- M-x org-trello-mode
- M-x org-trello-install-key-and-token
- Install is skipped as credentials already installed
- Delete ~/.emacs.d/.trello/<user>.el
- M-x org-trello-install-key-and-token
- Input *noise* as access key and token for the show (no need to leak stuff)
- Check the file `~/.emacs.d/trello/<user>.el` with the proper format

* Basic checks once everything is installed

People often opens issues about board not synchronizing. So in the end, showing
how to check everything is fine seems appropriate.

- First, `M-x org-trello-check-setup`
- Then, one can always check `~/.emacs.d/.trello/<user>.el`

* Attach board to buffer

- Opening new file
- M-x org-trello-mode
- M-x org-trello-install-board-metadata

* Update board metadata

- Open a file with existing out-dated metadata
- Update the board trello side
- M-x org-trello-update-board-metadata
- Ensure the new modification from the trello board are reported org-trello
  buffer side

* Sync to trello

- Open a file with no cards synced yet
- M-x org-trello-sync-buffer
- Check metadata on cards

* Sync from trello

- Open a file with only board metadata
- Ensure cards on trello board
- C-u M-x org-trello-sync-buffer
- Check cards display nicely

* Delete card from trello

- Open buffer with synced cards
- Place yourself on synced card
- M-x org-trello-kill-entity

* Delete all cards from trello

- Open buffer with synced cards
- Place yourself on synced card
- M-x org-trello-kill-cards

* Add comment to a card
* (Un)assign oneself to the card
* Display comments of the card
* Add/remove labels to card
* Setup org-trello activation for specific files
