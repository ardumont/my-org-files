Welcome to @ardumont's blog ([[https://github.com/ardumont][github]], [[https://twitter.com/ardumont][twitter]], ...).

I am an enthusiastic software developer/devops. I like to contribute to
multiple [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][libre software]] on my spare time.

Here you will find some notes on multiple subjects that I am interested in.

These are mostly notes or articles.

This might interest others as well so enjoy.
